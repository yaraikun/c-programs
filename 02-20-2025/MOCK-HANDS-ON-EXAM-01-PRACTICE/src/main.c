/*
    This is main.c file.  It contains the main() function for the PRACTICE problem.
	
	DO the following to test your LASTNAME-PRACTICE.c solution: 
	
	1. Edit Line 40 below to include your own source file.
	2. Compile this main.c file to produce main.exe.  Make sure to use -Wall compiler directive!
	3. If there are no compilation errors and/or warnings, go to the Command Line Interface via CMD. 
	4. Run main.exe in the command line with I/O redirection as follows:
   
           	main < INPUT.txt > LASTNAME-ACTUAL.txt           	

	   where INPUT.txt is an accompanying sample text files that contain input data 
	   read via scanf() in the Initialize() function.

       For example, if your lastname is SANTOS, you should run main.exe as:
	   
       		main < INPUT.txt > SANTOS-ACTUAL.txt
		      
    5. Using Notepad (or other text editors), open and compare your LASTNAME-ACTUAL.txt with the 
	   contents of the accompanying EXPECTED.TXT file. They should be exactly the same -- even the spacing!
	   If they are not the same, then there's a strong probability that there's a logical error in your 
	   solution, or you did not follow some specifications.  

	6. Debug and retry until you get the correct results.    
	   
	7. Devise your own tests. Do NOT simply depend on the sample INPUT and EXPECTED results.
